Optimized-Bank-Account-Hashing
<br>
This project involves designing and implementing a hashmap to manage a large-scale banking system's account information using hash functions. The hashmap stores bank accounts identified by a combination of their IFSC code and account number. The goal is to ensure efficient storage, retrieval, and security of account data. Collision resolution strategies will be explored to handle scenarios where multiple accounts map to the same hash code, ensuring organized and accessible data management. This project aims to optimize banking operations by leveraging robust data structures and algorithms.
